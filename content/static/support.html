  	<a href="https://processingfoundation.org">The Processing Foundation</a> was founded in 2012 after more than a decade of work with the Processing software. The Foundation’s mission is to promote software literacy within the visual arts, and visual literacy within technology-related fields — and to make these fields accessible to diverse communities. Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources. You can read more about the history of Processing in the short essay "<a href="https://medium.com/processing-foundation/a-modern-prometheus-59aed94abe85" target="_blank">A Modern Prometheus</a>".
